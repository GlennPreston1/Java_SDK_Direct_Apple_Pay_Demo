# EVO Payments - Turnkey API - JAVA SDK
Java integration (library, samples etc.) to the Turnkey API.

* __java-sdk-core__ the core code, can be used as libarary (as a JAR dependency)
* __java-sdk-command-line-client__ a Java based command line client to the Turnkey API (can be used via command line from non-Java applications too)
* __java-sdk-webapp-client__ a Java based webapp client to the Turnkey API, a kind of helper webapp (can be used from non-Java applications too)
* __java-sdk-sample-webshop__ a simple example webshop, demonstrates basic java-sdk-core usage
* __java-sdk-tester-tool__ further examples, test/debug tools etc. (these can help you to understand the API and the SDK, but most likely no relevant in production)
